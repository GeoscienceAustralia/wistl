Introduction
************

| Severe wind hazard can pose a significant risk to high voltage transmission lines consisting of various types of towers such as suspension, tension, and terminal towers. Geoscience Australia (GA) has developed a software called WISTL (Wind Impact Simulation on Transmission Lines) based on a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the damage likelihood to transmission lines. 
| It simulates two different damage mechanisms: damage due to direct wind assuming towers are isolated, and cascading failure mechanisms where damage is induced by the collapse of adjacent towers.  
| It produces a damage probability for each damage state by tower and probability distribution of the number of damaged towers by line.

Background
==========
The original methodology was developed for the Critical Infrastructure Protection Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA) capability for assessing the likelihood of tower failure for a range of transmission tower and conductor types. CIPMA is a program managed by the Federal Attorney-Generalâ€™s Department and Geoscience Australia (GA) is leading the technical development. The methodology was presented in :cite:`AhmedArthurEdwards2010,AhmedEdwards2010`, and applied for a project examining towers in Gladstone region in 2006. The methology was subsequently refined and implemented in Python for a strudy of the vulnerability of the Metro Manila electricity transmission system to typhoons.

Overall logic
=============
The primary mechanism for wind damage to transmission towers is the direct action of wind on a tower and conductors in severe wind events such as tropical cyclones. The secondary mechanism of damage is the collapse of neighbouring towers with the transfer of load to adjacent towers due to unbroken conductors. Collapse of one tower leads to additional pulling load on neighbouring towers connected to it in addition to wind loads. A cluster of towers can fail from the initiation of a primary failure due to wind with the subsequent pull down of neighbouring towers. This phenomenon is referred to as a cascading failure.

Damage due to the direct action of wind was modelled by defining tower fragility functions. The fragility functions are defined with respect to the type of tower based on functionality.
The cascading failure in the event of a primary tower failure was modelled by defining conditional probabilities for potential collapse patterns. Different sets of conditional probabilities were defined with respect to the function of the primary collapse tower.

Caveats and limitations
=======================

WISTL has been developed as a tool to provide information on vulnerability of trasmission lines to wind hazard. The methodology of simulation of wind damage to transmission lines are based on various assumptions. Therefore the simulation outcomes should be interpreted with caution given the assumptions.
